# DirectX-Snake-2.0
Progress: Still in-progress, with notable bugs to be fixed, and a number of additions to be made, such as a point system, speed changes, collision detection, and general game logic.

This game I call "Snake 2.0". Created with DirectX and the Open-Source ChiliFramework.

My code can be found in the Game.cpp and Game.h files. More specifically, in the Game.h file, my member functions and data members are everything below the "/* User Functions  */" comment. And, in the Game.cpp file, my code is inside Game::UpdateModel(), Game::ComposeFrame(), and all the member functions below them. The rest of the code is from the ChiliFramework, which mainly handles windows creation with winAPI, setting up graphics, sound, and keyboard/mouse input providing the developer with a functions to interact with.

Controls:

W or UpArrow: Move up  
A or LeftArrow: Move left  
S or DownArrow: Move down  
D or RightArrow: Move right  
Shift: Show grid  
Ctrl: RGB Changing Colors!
